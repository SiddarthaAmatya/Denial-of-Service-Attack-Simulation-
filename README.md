# Denial-of-Service-Attack-Simulation-
Simulated a UDP flood DoS attack in a secure virtual lab following the PTES framework. Used tools like Nmap, Wireshark, hping3, and Metasploit to identify vulnerabilities and exploit the EternalBlue flaw. Proposed multi-layered mitigation strategies to improve system resilience.
